Hello everyone, welcome to my second TOP project! This project is a recreation of a webpage design provided to me by the Odin Project. I will be demonstrating all I have learned about CSS up until now, including colors, fonts, and alignment especially the Flexbox specification! With that being said, thank you for stopping by and I hope you like the project!

--- DISCLAIMER ---
Any and all media used in this project in any form (images, text information, etc) is not my own. Their places in my project are simply to demonstrate my knowledge of the CSS language. As I work through this project, I will link all of the sources used here, please go and support all the amazing people who have made them!
